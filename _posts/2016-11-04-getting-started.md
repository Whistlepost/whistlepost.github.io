There are multiple options for installing and maintaining a Whistlepost platform.

## Containerisation

The recommended approach for a Whistlepost development environment is to use [Docker]


## Build from source

You can clone the [Git repository] and build from source using the following command:

    $ ./gradlew build

[Docker]: http://docker.io
[Git repository]: https://github.com/micronode/whistlepost
