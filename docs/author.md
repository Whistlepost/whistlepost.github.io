# Authoring Content

## Editors

Whilst some content can be sufficiently defined with plain text, sometimes there is a need
for richer formatting and layouts. To support such content Whistlepost provides a selection
of editors capable of capturing and rendering markup and rich content formats.

## Structured Content

Whilst every Whistlepost site may choose to render content in unique ways, we can define
some common structured metadata that is typical for a particular type of page. Using common
types allows us to provide consistent formatting a layout of pages and page sections.

### Article

A news article is typically defined to include a tile, an abstract, a cover image, and a body of text.

### Recipe

A recipe consists of a title, an abstract, a cover image, a list of ingredients, and a method.

### Advertisement

An advertisement may consist of a title, a thumbnail image and a full-size image.

### Collection

A collection will consist of a title, a description, a page count (for paging resources), and a list of resources
included in the collection.

## Sitemap

TBD.
